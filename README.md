aard2-themes
===

Download any `.css` file you wish from `themes` folder, then choose this file in your `Aard2` app.

All the themes are based on the `VSCode` themes, and none is created by me *(read [__metainf.json](./themes/__metainf.json) if you want to know where I've downloaded them from)*. I just convert them using [a2tg.py](./a2tg.py).

This repo does not include the original themes, if you want to compile the themes, then download them by writing:

```bash
python a2tg.py download
```

If you want to create your own, just put the `.json` files in `themes` folder and run `a2tg.py`.
